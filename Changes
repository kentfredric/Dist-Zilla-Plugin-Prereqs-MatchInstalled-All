 [00 Minor]
 - No important code changes
 - Just packaging changes downstream vendors who work by hand may have to worry about.

 [01 Toolkit Change]
 - Uses ExtUtils::MakeMaker instead of Module::Build
 - Dependencies softened ( aka: No longer building with ourselves )

 [02 Version scheme change]
 - now uses x.123456 instead of x.y.z
 - this is the primary reason for the 1.x on the box.
